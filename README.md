A selection of custom BBedit Language Modules for the excellent [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit). 

## About
Some custom language modules for BBedit. All of which are simple modules without code elements.
Created to make viewing and modifying files easier.  

### Modules
The list of modules include: 
- `BunchLanguage.plist` for use with [Bunch.app files](https://bunchapp.co)  
	Makes your editing of Bunch a touch easier to read.
- `AppleScript.plist` so you can edit those lovely AppleScripts outside of ScriptEditor. Just because that is nice sometimes.


## System Requirements
- BBEdit < v14.0.0


## Installation
1. Simply download the .plist file you are looking for (or all of them) from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/aarblaster/bbeditLanguageModules/releases/).
2. Move the file(s) you want to the BBEdit Language folder. By default this folder can be found at `~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules`.
3. Quit and reopen BBEdit.

## Usage
Once you have completed installation the language should be available to BBEdit. You can make changes anytime you like.

## Contributions
If you have ideas or contributions I'm very interested. I'm really new to coding and making it up as I go, so suggestions are welcome.   
If you encounter a problem you can raise and issue using the issue tab on Github.
